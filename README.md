### Greetings ðŸ‘‹
My name is Stephen Davis and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Purdue University. 

Right now my interests mainly consist of various different python projects including discord bots and packages to help automate away tedious tasks. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [pencil-pusher](https://github.com/stephend017/pencil-pusher) which is a github action that automatically publishes python docstrings to a repo wiki
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: stephenedavis17@gmail.com
- ðŸ¥… My goal for 2021 is to fully automate the maintainence of my python repos
  - [x] project templates [python-package-template](https://github.com/stephend017/python-package-template) & [python-github-action](https://github.com/stephend017/python-github-action)
  - [x] auto doc generation and publishing [pencil-pusher](https://github.com/stephend017/pencil-pusher)
  - [ ] auto releasing [snake-charmer](https://github.com/stephend017/snake_charmer)
  - [ ] auto identifying relevant test cases were added during each PR
